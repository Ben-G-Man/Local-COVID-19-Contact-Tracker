# Local-COVID-19-Contact-Tracker
By **Benjamin Hume** and **Ethan Corbertt**

**NOTE**: This app was built to be submitted as a Highschool assignment when I was 17, the quality of my code and my ability to write comments has improved dramatically since then.

## Features

- Stores accounts and associated activity locally as TXT files.
- COVID-19 safety advice is presented on the landing page, and will refresh with new information each time the app is opened.
- Global COVID-19 statistics from the John Hopkins univeristy database are formatted and presented on the landing page in real time.
- An administration account can be accessed to retrieve activity associated with a specific user or location.
- A settings page allows accounts to be easily modified or deleted once created.
- There are **five** distinct time-dependent UI themes, which activate automatically to improve viewing comfort.
