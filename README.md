By **Benjamin Hume** and **Ethan Corbertt**

**NOTE**: I created this application as part of a Highschool assignment when I was 17, the quality of my code has improved dramatically since then.

##How To Use

Open this folder on a Windows machine, then navigate to *dist/Contact Tracker/Contact Tracker.exe*

This application features an admin interface designed to help users retrieve an individual's recent activity if they test positive for COVID-19.
In order to access this menu, enter **ADMIN** into the email AND password text boxes when logging in. To test the interface enter a registered email, you can create an account using the apps account registration screen
or use an existing account such as:
Email:    **ben@example**
Password: **Seceret**
